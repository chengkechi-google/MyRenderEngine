# MyRenderEngine

I am trying to build this rendering engine when I am learning D3D12. I am trying to implement new graphics features in this learning project
## Planned feature:
### Abstract Rendering Interface
### Render Graph
- Auto resource barrier
- Multi Thread Rendering Command recording (pending)
- Resource Memory alias
- Output render graph
- Async Compute with the correct resource barrier
### Bindless Resource
- Dynamic Descriptor Index
### Mesh Shading
- Meshlet support
### GPU Driven
- 2 Phase Occlusion Culling
- Meshlet culling
- Compute indirect argument Buffer
### Ray Tracing
