# MyRenderEngine

I am trying to build this rendering engine when I am learning D3D12. It can not compile after I decided to refine it because I want to implement some ideas from Unreal Engine, and I hope I can implement most of new graphics API features.
## Planned feature:
### Abstract Rendering Interface
### Render Graph
- Auto resource barrier
- Multi Thread Rendering Command recording
- Resource Memory aliase
- Output graph
### Bindless Resource
### Ray Tracing
### Mesh Shading
